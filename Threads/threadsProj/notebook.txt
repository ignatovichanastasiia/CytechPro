In one of thine, from that which thou departest;

And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,

				As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow’st

In one of thine, from that which thou departest;

And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,

Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
